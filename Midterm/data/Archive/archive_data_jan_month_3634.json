{"lead_paragraph": "DUNHAM--William B.,died on January 11 in New York. Although he had a long career in finance, human resources, and real estate, he is best remembered for his role in the traditional jazz scene. First drawn to jazz in boyhood, he played with the Crimson Stompers at Harvard as part of the then thriving college jazz band circuit. Eventually settling in New York, Mr. Dunham organized one of the early traditional jazz bands, the Grove Street Stompers, to play Monday nights in Greenwich Village. Mr. Dunham led the band for over fifty years. At times leading jazz musicians, such as Wild Bill Davison were featured with the group. Arthurs Tavern, where the band played, remains one of the most celebrated locations for traditional jazz world-wide, still following the format instituted by Mr. Dunham. He is survived by his beloved wife, Sonya, daughter Amy, son-in- law Richard and three grand children.
