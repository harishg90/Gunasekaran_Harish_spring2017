He held senior positions with the United States government, including Deputy Attorney General under Robert F. Kennedy and Deputy Assistant of the Treasury and Director of Law Enforcement under Secretaries of the Treasury David Kennedy, John Connally and George Schultz. He helped develop civil rights legislation and developed and coordinated law enforcement policy within the Treasury Department, including the IRS, Customs, Secret Service and Interpol. In addition to service on various Cabinet committees, Martin headed the U.S. Delegation to several Interpol General Assemblies and, after returning to private practice, he was appointed by Secretary of State William P. Rogers as the U.S. representative to the International Narcotics Control Board of the United Nations, a position he held for several years. Over the years, Martin received numerous honors and awards, including the Townsend Harris Medal in 2005 and the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2007. After serving as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Martin, in private practice, advised and represented individuals, including CEO's of major corporations as well as numerous luminaries, and companies; investigated corporate misconduct; and untangled complex tax issues, workouts and bankruptcies. Notwithstanding a stellar legal career, nothing delighted him more than his family. He is survived by his wife Valerie, his sons Daniel and Richard, and their spouses, Melissa and Deb, granddaughters Gabriella, Rebekah and Lexi, and his brother Philip. He was entirely unique, and we will miss him. For those who wish to honor his memory, we ask that donations be made to The Rogosin Institute, www.rogosin.org/donate, The Hebrew Home at Riverdale, or Cardiovascular Institute Fund of Mt.
