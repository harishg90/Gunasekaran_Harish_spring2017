{"lead_paragraph": "MENDELSON--Solomon. The Cantors Assembly sadly notes the passing of its distinguished past president, Hazzan Solomon Mendelson. Sol was a visionary with the capacity to realize many of his dreams, teaching his colleagues to reach well beyond the roles most often associated with a Cantor.
